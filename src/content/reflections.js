    q: 'Should users be expected to understand the full risks of sharing genetic data, or is it the company\'s duty to protect them regardless of user awareness?',
    a: 'Users can read the terms, but they rarely understand the full scope of risks, because genetic data cannot be changed like a password. A leak can affect health, insurance, or even family safety. That makes the company the main bearer of responsibility. Users should still avoid oversharing, use strong passwords, and be aware of enabled features.'

    q: 'If a single person\'s genetic data also reveals information about their relatives, who has the right to decide how that data is stored or shared?',
    a: 'Genetic data is never only individual. By uploading my DNA I also expose information that belongs to my parents, siblings, and children, even if they never gave consent. This creates a conflict between individual choice and collective privacy. A fair approach is to let individuals decide about their own participation, but companies must design features so that relatives are not automatically pulled into exposure. For example, relative-matching should always be optional, with clear warnings that participation affects others. Families should also have channels to object when their privacy is indirectly compromised. In this way, both the individual and the group interests are recognized.'

  {
    q: 'Who should be held more responsible in this case: the users who reused weak passwords, or the company that failed to enforce stronger security measures?',
    a: 'Users share some blame because reusing passwords is a bad habit that makes attacks easier. But it is also predictable, and any company handling highly sensitive data must assume that people will make mistakes. Modern security design works on the principle of expecting failure and building defenses that still hold. That means enforcing two-factor authentication by default, limiting repeated login attempts, and checking new passwords against known breach lists. Responsibility is therefore shared, but the larger burden rests with the company, because it sets the system rules and has the resources to protect even imperfect users.'

  {
    q: 'If existing laws do not clearly cover genetic data, should companies act only within the law, or do they have a duty to go beyond it?',
    a: 'The law is always slower than technology, so following only the legal minimum leaves people exposed. Genetic data is especially sensitive because it cannot be changed and because it affects families and groups, not just the person who gave a sample. For that reason companies have an ethical duty to go further than the letter of the law. A responsible company would introduce stronger encryption, independent security audits, strict limits on data sharing, and transparent ways for users to control or delete their information, even if the law does not yet demand it. Other industries that deal with irreversible risks, such as medicine, already operate under higher standards than the legal minimum. The same approach should apply to genetic data.'
